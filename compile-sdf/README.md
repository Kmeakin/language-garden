# An embedded DSL for compiling signed-distance functions

TL;DR: I was doing [a tutorial](https://inspirnathan.com/posts/47-shadertoy-tutorial-part-1/)
on how to use procedural graphics on the GPU and was irritated by the lack of
higher-order functions, parametric polymorphism, and an effect system in GLSL. ðŸ¥²

[Signed distance functions] (SDFs)  are a powerful approach for rendering
procedural graphics in parallel on the GPU, without the use of mesh geometry.
For more details see the  [resources](#resources) listed below. This is an
embedded DSL for composing SDFs in OCaml and compiling them to shader programs.

An example scene can be found in [Main.ml](./Main.ml), and the signature of
available signed distance functions can be found in [Sdf.ml](./Sdf.ml). The
resulting DSL is clunkier than Iâ€™d like. This is due to OCamlâ€™s odd approach to
custom operators (which donâ€™t allow for custom precedences), and lack of
implicit overloading. Still, I think itâ€™s an interesting proof-of-concept!

Internally we use [tagless-final style] to implement the DSL. This means that
shader expressions are properly type-checked, and compilation to GLSL shaders is
reasonably straightforward. The resulting GLSL code can currently be seen [in
the CLI tests](./tests.t). In the future alternate back-ends for targets like
[HLSL], [MSL] and [SPIR-V] could also be implemented.
