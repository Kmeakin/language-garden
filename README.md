# Language garden ðŸŒ±

Some toy programming language implementations, mostly implemented in OCaml.

These projects are mostly my attempt to understand different techniques and
approaches to implementing programming languages. Perhaps from these seedlings
something new and interesting might germinate?

- [**compile-arith**](./compile-arith/): A compiler from tree-based arithmetic expressions to a stack machine.
- [**compile-arithcond**](./compile-arithcond/): A compiler from tree-based arithmetic and conditional expressions to a stack machine.
- [**elab-dependent**](./elab-dependent/): An tiny elaborator for a small dependently typed lambda calculus.
- [**elab-record-patching**](./elab-record-patching/): An elaborator of a dependently typed lambda calculus with singletons and record patching.
- [**wip-elab-dependent**](./wip-elab-dependent): An older elaborator for dependent types, will probably be deleted in the future.

## Development setup

Using [Nix] is not required, but can be useful for setting up a development
shell with the packages and tools used in this project. With [Nix flakes]
enabled and [nix-direnv] installed, run:

```sh
echo "use flake" > .envrc
direnv allow
```

Youâ€™ll want to locally exclude the `.envrc`, or add it to your global gitignore.

After that, dune can be used to build, test, and run the projects:

```sh
dune build
dune test
dune exec compile-arith <<< "1 + 2 * 27"
```

Alternatively, opam files are provided (but might be broken).
