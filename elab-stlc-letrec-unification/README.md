# Simply typed lambda calculus with recursive let bindings

Extends [**elab-stlc-unification**](../elab-stlc-unification).

This is an implementation of recursive let bindings for the simply typed lambda
calculus. These are elaborated to a primitive fixed-point combinator in the core
language. Implementing normalisation-by-evaluation with general recursion can be
challenging, and can result in evaluation diverging when quoting under
fixed-points. To prevent this this we avoid unfolding fixed-points during
quotation.

Thanks goes to [Karl Meakin](https://github.com/Kmeakin) for help in trying out
different approaches and pointing out bugs when implementing this.

## Examples

<!-- $MDX file=examples/readme.txt -->
```
let rec fact n :=
  if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);

fact 5
```

Elaborated program:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/readme.stdout -->
```
let fact : Int -> Int :=
  #fix (fact : Int -> Int) =>
    fun (n : Int) => if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1);
fact 5 : Int
```

More examples can be found in [`tests.t`](tests.t).
