# Simply typed lambda calculus with metavariable unification

This an elaborator for the simply typed lambda calculus that uses
_metavariables_ to allow programmers to omit type annotations. This approach is
a stepping-stone to more powerful type checking algorithms, such as those for
Hindley-Milner type systems.

This implementation is based on [Arad Arbel’s gist](https://gist.github.com/aradarbel10/837aa65d2f06ac6710c6fbe479909b4c).
It’s not a highly optimised implementation – the goal here is clarity.
