# Elaboration with Record Patching and Singleton Types

This is an implementation of a dependently typed language with dependent record
types, with some additional features intended to make it more convenient to use
records as first-class modules. It was originally ported from [a gist by mb64](
https://gist.github.com/mb64/04315edd1a8b1b2c2e5bd38071ff66b5).
